        I was born in the Philippines and immigrated the the US when I was 4 years old.
        As a kid I was very energetic, but have mellowed out as I aged.
        Despite being energetic, I was incredibly shy and found it hard to socialize well.
        I had friends, but it was difficult getting to know new people.
        As I grew up I may have simmered down in terms of the amount of energy I had.
        However, I also began to get better with speaking to people that I didn't know.
        Now I am completely comfortable with talking to strangers and getting to know new people.

        I have one sister and one brother, and I am the youngest between the three of us.
        I also have a pet dog.
        Her name is Panda because she kind of looks link a panda (Great naming there).
        We've had her for about nine years now and she's getting up there in age, which I am saddened by.

        I am a very cheap man.
        I am not lying.
        I am a <i>very</i> cheap man.
        I go out of my way to spend as little money as I possibly can, and I like to surround myself with similar people.
        There is no story to perfectly illustrate this as the time some friends and I went to watch a movie.
        When we left the theater we noticed it had started to rain.
        Instead of us eating lunch at a place next to the theater, we walked about a mile to get food that was a few dollars cheaper.
        The rain intensified as we walked and by the time we arrived, we are drenched head to toe in water.
