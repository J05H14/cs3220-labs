                    I'm not entirely sure about any one thing about myself that is more interesting than rest.
                    I have a lot of interests and hobbies, but none I consider a true passion.
                    I have found myself gaining on-and-off interests in many things.
                    TV, movies, pro-wrestling, sports, videogames, the list goes on. 
                    I have many things that I enjoy, but I don't have a particular passion.
                    I see my self as a Jack-of-All-Trades when it comes to my interests because I dont have an overwhelming passion to any specific thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also see myself as a very positve person.
                    I try to always see the brighter side of any situations.
                    I believe that it's always better to enjoy as much of life as you can.
                    "Every cloud has a silver lining" I like that saying because it makes me feel that there is always a bright side to any situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thing that I have enjoyed the longest has to be comedy.
                    Any form of comedy amuses me.
                    However, my favorite for of comedy is when something is so bad that it's funny.
                    That is one of the reasons why I love bad movies.
                    Whether it's for a ridiculous plot, bad acting, or an idiotic premise, I am amused by bad movies.
                    It's not just movies, I like "bad" jokes.
                    I enjoy bad puns, overly-simplistic jokes, and even knock-knock jokes as an adult!
